#! Fix the Errors / Comparing Arrays

# Programmer Pete is trying to create a function that returns True if two lists share the same length and have identical numberical values at every index.
    # Otherwise return False
# However, the solution his function gives is in an unexpected format.

def check_equals(lst1, lst2):
    return lst1 == lst2
